personal-autosetup-linux-ubuntu - Automatically sets up the system as I prefer, ignore if you're not... me? - Licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0.

The goal of this script is that I should be able to take literally ANY Ubuntu-based distro, or just base Ubuntu, and automatically turn it into an operating system and experience that I can reasonably use and enjoy, *regardless* of how it started off.
It removes stuff I don't want, adds stuff that I do, etc, etc.

I usually end up installing Ubuntu, or some Ubuntu varient, and then run this script. It's a good result.

I've tried to test this with as many of the official flavours, and all the community favourites in the top 100 on distrowatch, and more, as possible, so it should be well-working.

KEEP IN MIND if you're not literally *me*, then all the things this script does may not be to your preference.
