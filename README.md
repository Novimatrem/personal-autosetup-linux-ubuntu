personal-autosetup-linux-ubuntu - Automatically sets up the system as I prefer, ignore if you're not... me? - Licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0.

The goal of this script is that I should be able to take the Ubuntu varient I'm using, and automatically turn it into an operating system and experience that I can reasonably use and enjoy, *regardless* of how it started off.
It removes stuff I don't want, adds stuff that I do, etc, etc.

I usually only test this with Xubuntu, as I only use Xubuntu. If you don't use Xubuntu, it may not work. YMMV.
(it should work fine on most Ubuntu's, though..)

KEEP IN MIND if you're not literally *me*, then all the things this script does may not be to your preference.
